    <h2 align-self="center">Some Info on Our Hero</h2>
      <p id="tribute-info"> Son Goku is a fictional character and main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. 
        He is based on Sun Wukong (Monkey King), a main character in the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. 
        His origin story also shares some similarities with that of Superman. Goku first made his debut in the first Dragon Ball chapter, 
        Bulma and Son Goku, originally published in Japan's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984.<br> Born Kakarot, Goku is introduced as an eccentric, 
        monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the magical seven Dragon Balls 
        that can grant the user one wish. Along the way, he finds new friends who follow him on his journey to become a stronger fighter. As Goku grows up, he becomes the 
        Earth's mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends and family, while also gaining new allies in the process.</p>
      <p id="tribute-info"> Initially believed to have been born on Earth, Goku later learns that he is a member of an extraterrestrial warrior race called the Saiyans, 
        which is also the reason for his superhuman strength, and his birth name is Kakarot.<br><br> As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and protects 
        his adopted home planet from those who seek to destroy it. Goku is depicted as carefree and cheerful when at ease, but quickly serious and strategic-minded when in 
        battle and also enthusiastic to fight. He is able to concentrate his Ki and use it for devastatingly powerful energy-based attacks; the most prominent being his signature Kamehameha, 
        in which Goku launches a blue energy blast from his palms.<br><br>Also pure of heart, Goku has frequently granted mercy to his enemies, 
        which has often earned him additional allies in the process (though has also resulted in others taking advantage of his kindness), 
        and he is one of the few who can ride the magic cloud called "Flying Nimbus".</p>
